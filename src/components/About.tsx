            I&apos;m a Computer Science student with a strong analytical mindset
            and a deep curiosity about how systems work. I enjoy learning across
            different layers of software, from low-level programming to modern
            front-end deployment, and I&apos;m motivated by solving complex
            problems in clear, thoughtful ways.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            I&apos;m currently focused on building a strong foundation through
            coursework and hands-on projects, and I&apos;m excited to continue
            growing as a software engineer.
